<b>Backtracking Algorithm</b>

A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired output.

The Brute force approach tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the desired/best solutions.

The term backtracking suggests that if the current solution is not suitable, then backtrack and try other solutions. Thus, recursion is used in this approach.

This approach is used to solve problems that have multiple solutions. If you want an optimal solution, you must go for dynamic programming.

<b>Rabin-Karp Algorithm</b>

Rabin-Karp algorithm is an algorithm used for searching/matching patterns in the text using a hash function. Unlike Naive string matching algorithm, it does not travel through every character in the initial phase rather it filters the characters that do not match and then performs the comparison.

A hash function is a tool to map a larger input value to a smaller output value. This output value is called the hash value.
