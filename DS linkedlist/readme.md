# Linked list

1.Linked list
Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.

A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.

The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.

2.Doubly linked list

Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer).

3.Circular Singly Linked List

In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We can have circular singly linked list as well as circular doubly linked list.

We traverse a circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly liked list has no beginning and no ending. There is no null value present in the next part of any of the nodes.

4.Circular Doubly Linked List

Circular doubly linked list is a more complexed type of data structure in which a node contain pointers to its previous node as well as the next node. Circular doubly linked list doesn't contain NULL in any of the node. The last node of the list contains the address of the first node of the list. The first node of the list also contain address of the last node in its previous pointer.
