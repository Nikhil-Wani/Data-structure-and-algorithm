# Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment, without worrying about the future result it would bring. In other words, the locally best choices aim at producing globally best results.

This algorithm may not be the best option for all the problems. It may produce wrong results in some cases.

This algorithm never goes back to reverse the decision made. This algorithm works in a top-down approach.

The main advantage of this algorithm is:

1. The algorithm is easier to describe.
2. This algorithm can perform better than other algorithms (but, not in all cases).

<b>Ford-Fulkerson algorithm </b>

Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy approach for calculating the maximum possible flow in a network or a graph.
A term, flow network, is used to describe a network of vertices and edges with a source (S) and a sink (T). Each vertex, except S and T, can receive and send an equal amount of stuff through it. S can only send and T can only receive stuff.

<b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b>

Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph.
It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.

<b>Kruskal's Algorithm</b>

Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which

1. form a tree that includes every vertex
2. has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph

<b>Prim's Algorithm</b>

Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which

1. form a tree that includes every vertex
2. has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph

<b>Huffman Coding</b>

Huffman Coding is a technique of compressing data to reduce its size without losing any of the details. It was first developed by David Huffman.
Huffman Coding is generally useful to compress the data in which there are frequently occurring characters.
