# Some Demo codes

<b>Vector demo</b>

Vector is a template class in STL (Standard Template Library) of C++ programming language. C++ vectors are sequence containers that store elements. Specifically used to work with dynamic data, C++ vectors may expand depending on the elements they contain. That makes it different from a fixed-size array.


<b>deque demo</b>

A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar to the queue. It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items remain positioned in the collection. In a sense, this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure
